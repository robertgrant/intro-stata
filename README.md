## Note! I no longer use Github. This repo may be out of date.

All my ex-Github repos are now stored and maintained at [my personal website](http://www.robertgrantstats.co.uk/code.html).

Why did I leave Github? Because I consider the compulsory imposition of 2-factor authentication to be inappropriate for people writing software, including cryptography, which can attract severe punishments in certain jurisdictions. We all know that the organisations that hold the 2nd factors (mobile telephony providers, tech companies) are compromised, willingly or otherwise, in their relationships with security agencies, benign or otherwise.

Why not just close it down? Because you might use it programmatically, via http or API, and I don't want to hurt you (by breaking your code) while trying to help you (by raising issues of privacy and confidentiality).



# Material for an introductory Stata course

The files in this repository include data, slides etc. It is worth downloading everything as .zip into one folder, or cloning the repository, if you can.

The only files you will directly interact with are the **Intro-to-stata.pdf** slides, the **Stata cheat sheet.pdf** list of commands that we will encounter, and the .do files for each session, with names like **day-1-session-1...**. Everything else is accessed from inside those.

Contact me if you stumble upon this repository and would like a course along these lines. "It's what we do."
